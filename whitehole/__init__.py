WhiteHole: A Unified Model of Black Holes, White Holes, and Cosmic Blinking

This package formalizes the theoretical framework connecting:

- Black/White hole superposition and quantum transitions

- Linguistic-semantic operators (Subject, Verb, Object)

- Prime gap modulation of cosmic rhythms

- Universe blinking patterns and information flow

- Tesseract-based multidimensional mappings
